# Reflections

## Class 3

This class taught me the importance of work flow and making sure you are keeping track of what you are changing and why. You need to be able to reference back to why that change happened in order to remember what happened.  

It also taught me how to utilize tools through ubuntu making my code that much easier to read. This is such a life saver when it comes to debuging and trouble shooting.
