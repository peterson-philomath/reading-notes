### Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is having the mindset that you can always improve and always learn more. 

**Reminders:**

- Just because it is hard doesn't mean it isn't possible to learn
- When frustrated take a break and come back with a refreshed mind
- Everything you have ever learned started with knowing nothing about it.
