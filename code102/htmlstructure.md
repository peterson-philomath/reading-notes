   - **Opening tag**: Consists of the name of the element wrapped in angle brackets (<>)
   - **Closing tag**: Same as the opening tag except it has a forward slash before the element name surrounded by angle brackets (</>)
   - **The Content**: What is being added to the webpage
   - Altogether it makes an **element**
3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?
   - **Attributes** will give extra information about how the element should be handled.  
   - Should always have:
     - a space between it and the element name (or previous attribute, if element has more than one attribute).
     - The attribute name is followed by an equal sign.
     - The attribute value is wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
