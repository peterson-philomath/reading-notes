## Notes from Readings

1. **What is control flow?**
   - The ordering by which a computer  executes code.
   - It goes line by line until it finds a condition or a loop.
2. **What is a JavaScript function?**
   - A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.  
   - It executes when something calls it or invokes it.  
3. **What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?**
   - It means at that point run the code inside of the function.  
   - function name()
   - Examples of invocation
     - Event occurs (button push)
     - When it called from JavaScript code
     - Automatically (self-invoked)
4. **What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?**
   - parentheses include parameter names separated by a comma. It is the input that the function is expecting when it runs.
