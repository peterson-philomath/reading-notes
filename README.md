## About Me

My Name is Philip Peterson (he/him), and I am in Oregon (Pacific Time). I am a middle school teacher who is hoping to teach 7th/8th graders how to code. I have a background in technology as I studied electrical and computer engineering for a time before switching to become a teacher and I use to maintain computers and networks for different companies.

### Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is having the mindset that you can always improve and always learn more. 

**Reminders:**

- Just because it is hard doesn't mean it isn't possible to learn
- When frustrated take a break and come back with a refreshed mind
- Everything you have ever learned started with knowing nothing about it.
